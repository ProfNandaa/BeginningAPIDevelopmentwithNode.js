# Beginning API Development with Node.js
The bots are taking over and we’re all for it! Messenger-based bots will be the dominant software UI for the next generation of applications – even Slack, Telegram, and Facebook are driving a new approach where “threads are the new apps.” This book shows you how to create work automation bots that interact with users through Slack, e-mail, Skype, Twitter, and more using Node.js. You’ll learn to create conversational UIs for your Node.js apps, and then use those UIs to provide workflow automation tools. You will be shown how to handle customer service requests that come in through messenger systems – this includes interpreting the natural language to reveal the user’s intent and respond accordingly. You will also learn how to automate processes that involve several people, such as processing holiday requests, arranging meetings, or sending updated reports on time. By the end of this book you’ll have the knowledge to create bots that can handle and manipulate documents, URLs, and other items of content. Harness the power of bots and your organization will reap the benefits.
